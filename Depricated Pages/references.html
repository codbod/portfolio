      <p>"One of Cody's biggest goals at the start of the summer was building his leadership skills. He was a natural leader in the project lead role, 
        and really fell in line as the Project Manager. Keeping the team on task, vocalizing key issues that needed to be addressed, and running the 
        Sprint Review each week were big things that Cody accomplished this summer. From our consultants who he assisted with at DOH, they were so impressed 
        with Kai and Cody's work ethic and commented that would do a reference or letter of recommendation based on the work they did. We hope that Cody can 
        rejoin us for another summer at Pacxa to support our next group of interns."</p>
